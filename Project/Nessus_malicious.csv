This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial

need to be done again.","Steps to resolve this issue include :
